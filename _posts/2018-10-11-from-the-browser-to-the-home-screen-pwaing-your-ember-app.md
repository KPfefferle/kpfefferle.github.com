For EmberConf, we built a cutting-edge Ember mobile web app to serve as a convenient up-to-the-minute reference for the conference's schedule. Now updated for EmberFest, I'll highlight how we made this conference schedule app a fully compliant Progressive Web App. We'll walk through the steps needed to take your mobile Ember app out of the mobile browser and onto your users' home screens. With new native platform support available just this year and the backing of the always-amazing Ember addon ecosystem, making your Ember app fully PWA capable has never been easier or more worthwhile.

I shared this talk at [EmberFest](https://emberfest.eu/) in Amsterdam on October 11, 2018.
