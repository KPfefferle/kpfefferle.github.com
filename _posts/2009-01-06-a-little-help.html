My excuse for sporadic updates? I've been crazy busy with miscellaneous site changes, a <a href="/visitors/theater/wild-ocean/" target="_blank">new movie</a>, a <a href="/visitors/coming-attractions/" target="_blank">coming traveling exhibit</a>, and pages for two new permanent exhibit installations (one complete, one under construction).
