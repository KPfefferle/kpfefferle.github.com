As of the end of the month, I will be moving on from my current position as Web Manager at [COSI](http://www.cosi.org/) to join the web engineering and design team at [dynamIt](http://dynamit.us/).

I have very much enjoyed investing the past 15 months at COSI, and I continue to be amazed at all of the wonderful things I have been a part of here. Being a member of Central Ohio's 2009 Marketing Team of the Year (thanks [Kelli](http://twitter.com/KNowinsky), [Carli](http://twitter.com/CLanfersiek), [Doug](http://twitter.com/dougbuchananjr), and [Chris](http://twitter.com/crhurtubise)!) has been a real joy, and I look forward to aiding COSI in continuing such important work as a devoted COSI member and donor. COSI's mission to inspire a love of science and technology in all generations certainly helped me end up in the field I'm in, and I am confident COSI will continue to inspire Columbus and Ohio for many generations to come.

I have long admired the crew at dynamIt, both for the high quality of their work as a firm and for the friendships I have already started to form with many of the team members. I look forward to working with their quality clientele and to making a positive contribution to web through their strategic approach to web development and digital marketing. I truly believe that dynamIt is helping to change the landscape of web development in Columbus for the better, and I look forward to contributing to that positive impact.

Farewell COSI — it truly has been a wonderful experience.

Hello dynamIt — I can't wait to see what we will achieve together!
