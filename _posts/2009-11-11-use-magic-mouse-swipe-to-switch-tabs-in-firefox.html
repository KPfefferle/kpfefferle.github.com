I picked up my <a title="Apple Magic Mouse" href="http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/" target="_blank">Apple Magic Mouse</a> a couple weeks ago, and I am totally in love with it. However, most of the programs I regularly use for web development don't take advantage of the two-finger swipe gesture. Luckily, Firefox includes support for gestures that let me set up my mouse to switch tabs with the left/right swipe!
<h2>How to Do It</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open Firefox.</li>
	<li>Type "about:config" into the address bar. After a warning about voiding your warranty (on a free open source product), screwing up your browser, and/or creating a wrinkle in the space/time continuum, this will bring up the Firefox configuration options.</li>
	<li>Use the filter box to search for "gesture.swipe" and you should see the results below.</li>
	<li>Double-click on the values for "browser.gesture.swipe.left" and "browser.gesture.swipe.right" and change them to "Browser:PrevTab" and "Browser:NextTab" respectively.</li>
	<li>Resume browsing as usual and enjoy your new tab-swiping functionality!</li>
</ol>

MUCH better than the default back/forward swipe functionality!

<strong>UPDATE (12/14/09):</strong> If you are interested in doing much more with your Mighty Mouse than this, you might want to check out <a title="BetterTouchTool" href="http://blog.boastr.net/" target="_blank">BetterTouchTool</a>, a utility for adjusting all sorts of gestures for both the MacBook touch pad and the Mighty Mouse (they have good taste in WP theme also)!
